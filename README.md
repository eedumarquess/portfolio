## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the Vue portfolio project, which includes 4 basic pages: "home", "about me", "projects" and "contact". The project is responsive and can be accessed on mobile phones. It is currently made in pure CSS, but there are plans to move to SCSS or a framework like Tailwind.

## Technology Stack
The following technologies were used in the project:

- Vue.js framework
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Figma for prototyping

## Pages
### Home Page
The home page serves as the landing page for the portfolio. It includes a brief introduction of the developer and links to other pages of the site. The design of the home page is simple and minimalist, reflecting the developer's style.

### About Me Page
The about me page provides a more detailed introduction of the developer, including their skills, experience, and education. 

### Projects Page
The projects page showcases the developer's previous work, including links to other sites or projects on which they collaborated. The page is designed to highlight the developer's skills and experience in various areas.

### Contact Page
The contact page provides a form for potential clients or employers to contact the developer. The page also includes the developer's contact information, such as email and phone number.

## Design Process
The Figma prototyping tool was used to create the design for the portfolio project. Figma allowed for the creation of a responsive design that could be viewed on both desktop and mobile devices. The design was refined through multiple iterations to achieve the desired look and feel.

## Installation Guide
To install the Vue portfolio project, follow these steps:

- Clone the project from the GitHub repository

## Future Plans
The developer plans to migrate the project from pure CSS to SCSS or a framework like Tailwind to improve maintainability and scalability. Additionally, the developer plans to deploy other animations with CSS and JavaScript to make the portfolio more visually appealing and engaging for users.

The animations will be implemented in a way that does not compromise the website's performance or accessibility. The developer will also ensure that the animations do not interfere with the user experience or make the website difficult to navigate.
